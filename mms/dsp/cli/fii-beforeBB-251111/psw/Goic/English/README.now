The Status menus and the equipment menus are generated through
a utility. They are not checked in. They are generated on site from
PITDAT information. In addition, the Location menus are generated
dynamically by the gc_menud and loaded to the GCs on powerup or request.
The only file of these that is checked in is the one that that all
the others are linked to.
