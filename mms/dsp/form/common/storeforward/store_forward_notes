Store and Forward Notes

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. sf_test script
This is a test script to test the Store and Forward Event Handler. It is 
designed to run with real time Dispatch. A data file contains a set of
equipment actions. The actions are designated as FIELD or SPOOL actions.
The FIELD actions are sent to real time Dispatch and recorded in the RPCSPL
table. The SPOOL actions are only recorded in the RPCSPL table. This is
used to build a set of test data that the SF_Handler process can use to
test the functionality of the Store and Forward process. The script takes
from one to three arguments. The first is the path and name of the data file
to process.
The second argument, which is optional, is the debug level. Allowable
values for debug level are 0, 1, and 2. The higher the debug level the more
information is displayed as the script runs.
The third argument which is also optional is the pause time between events.
If no value is given it defaults to 1 second. Any number of seconds can be
entered.

USAGE: sf_test <data file> <debug level (optional)> <pause time (optional)>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. SF_Handler script
This is the script that runs the Store and Forward event handler. This
script is run any time you wish to process events from the RPCSPL table.
The process takes two arguments. The first is the client path (for instance
/dsp/cli/syslab2). The second argument, which is optional, is the debug
level for the event log. If the debug level argument is not given it is
defaulted to 0. It can be set to 1 or 2. The higher the debug level the more
information is recorded in the event log. 

USAGE: SF_Handler <client> <debug level (optional)>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. sf_process.frm
This is the main form that is run by the SF_Handler script. It performs all
of the processing of the events stored in the RPCSPL table

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. setrpcsplstat.sh script
This script is used to reset the STATUS field for all events in 
the RPCSPL table. This script takes two arguments. The first is the old value for the STATUS field that you want changed and the second is the new value that you wish STATUS changed to. This script was created for testing purposes only.

USAGE: setrpcsplstat.sh <old value> <new value>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. clear_rpcspl.sh script
This script is used to clear all events from the RPCSPL table. This is helpful
in testing.

USAGE: clear_rpcspl.sh
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Real time forms modified
   act_dispatch.frm - add call to store forward code for all PANEL actions
	for truck, exacv, and aux eqmt
   act_other.frm - no talk handler modified
   truckactions.frm - TruckActLate expression modified
   excavactions.frm - ExcavActLate expression modified
   auxactions.frm - AuxActLate expression modified
   except.frm - OTHER_30 exception added for store forward no comms
   switches.frm - added STOREFORWARD_MODULE switch
   storeforward/act_storeforward.frm - new form contains store forward logic
	for generating no comms exception
