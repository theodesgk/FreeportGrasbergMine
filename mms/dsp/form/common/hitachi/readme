directory

5) Make sure the Macro.cfg present in client psw/Hitachi or 
psw/boot/Hitachi contains the following rpc's

6) Load the excavator with the hitachi interface with the following
options

net/Hub/All CLASS=excav ID=xxx OPTIONS=Gps/xxx,Hitachi

Note: Run make before testing as changes have been made to enum.c
E&TYPE field should have "Hitachi model" as act_hitachi.frm
checks through the E$TYPE field to check if it contains the word
"Hitachi" and activates equipment of type "Hitachi" by sending
the appropriate rpc to turn the Hitachi system
