  IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT LINKS FILES FOR BOOT CODE

The boot code now includes support for DISPATCH NextGen. Classic DISPATCH
and DISPATCH NextGen share a common set of boot code. Since we cannot run
the INSTALL script on the Windows side to create all of the necessary links
used in Linux, the boot code now includes a set of links.cmd files that are
used to replicate the creating of links on the Windows side.

There is one links.cmd file for every .links file and it contains commands
to do the equivalent of creating links in Windows. The format is different.

1. for creating links to files the command "fsutil hardlink create" is used.
2. for creating links to directorires the command "junction" is used.
3. the argument order is reversed. The name of the link comes first and then
   the file that is being linked to.

for example a linux .links file might look like this:
ln -sf ../Main/All ./All
ln -sf ../../Hub/Macro.cfg ./excav/Macro.cfg
ln -sf ./excav ./loader

The corresponding links.cmd file would look like this:
fsutil hardlink create .\All ..\Main\All
fsutil hardlink create .\excav\Macro.cfg ..\..\Hub\Macro.cfg
junction .\loader .\excav

You can compare existing .links and links.cmd files in the boot code for
more examples.
